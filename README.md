# Welcome to my `Job App` project!

Job App is a simple CRU (CRUD app...without the delete) that allows a user to add a job posting and edit an existing job.

## Let's get started - TLDR!

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

--> Navigate to the home screen of the app [http://localhost:3000/home](http://localhost:3000/home)

### `yarn test`

This project uses [Jest Axe](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest-axe) to catch any potential acceessibility violations and [Jest Snapshots](https://jestjs.io/docs/snapshot-testing) for our UI component testing.

### sass --watch src/index.scss build/index.css  

Run this command to compile your sass styling updates


## Let's get started - the longer version. :) 

There are a few key concepts I'd like to elaborate on
1. File structure
2. Code style && React Hooks
3. Accessibility 
4. Testing
5. Styles
6. A little reflection (an optional read..)
